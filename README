Open Source Bitcoin Exchange

http://www.bitcoin.org

Created as a response to closed source exchanges like:
Mt Gox: http://www.mtgox.com
Tradehill: http://www.tradehill.com
Ruxum: http://www.ruxum.com

Please fork/commit/push :)

To run, git clone the source, then cd in directory 'bundle install' and 'thin start'

I have code for interacting with dwolla and bitcoin daemon, but they're under construction
